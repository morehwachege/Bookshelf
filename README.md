# Libre - a reponsive single page app template for collection management projects.

![Libre](./Screenshot1.png)

Libre is a responsive single page app template designed to filter data from web-applications as a mirror site to ease consumer reach of books. Built with tailwind.css and vanilla javascript of the front end, it incorporates python for task automation. Libre scrapes data on the backend from  the manybooks website gathering images, links and names for each iteration of a single book using python packages such as Beautiful Soup 4, requests and a html parser -> lxml parser.

## Running the project locally->Front-end manipulation
Make sure your local version is v6+. I currently we are using v10.8 as of March 2021.
```
npm install
```

If you want to regenerate css with your changes, run this command to generate css using tailwind config (e.g. tailwind.js)
```
$ ./node_modules/.bin/tailwind build style.css -c ./tailwind.js -o ./output.css
```

If you want to recompile the javascript, make sure browserify is installed globally then run this command to create bundle.js
```
$ npm install -g browserify
$ browserify main.js -o bundle.js
```
